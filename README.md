# Course Recommender System

The goal of this project is to deliver a recommendation system model using the scraped data from Coursera, and the model is built using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find the closest matches to the user inputs.The model is integrated with a front end web app using Streamlit to provide a highly enriching user experience. 



  # Background & Motivation:

  The dataset contains courses to learn on different topics including crypto trading, data science, graphic design, and software engineering. Each of these data contains detailed information such as course name, learner level, course description, course detail, career path, and learning platform. Such high level (course topics) and detailed information (course details) can help us build recommendation systems and help us make better predictions that keep the user retention rate. They can also be used to draw and understand the relationship between topics, users, and platforms for user preferences through data mining techniques. 


# Python Libraries Used:

- TF-IDF Matrix
- Cosine Similarity
- Spyder python IDE to deploy the app using Streamlit
- Streamlit to deploy the model on the front end


# Summary:

Below image shows final output containing the recommendations for the given user input.Based on the input provided by the user, we use NLP and cosine similarity techniques to get the accurate list of recommendations matching the user input.
